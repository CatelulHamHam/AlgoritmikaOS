## Who are we?
A bunch of really bored programmers that work in teaching programming to little children from ages 5-16... 

## What is this really
This is currently a lightweight WindowsXLite10-based operating system (made for Dell Latitude 4800 and sum Weigo laptops that are very cheap and I don't like them :P)  which is very restricted because the children we teach are naughty and they change the wallpaper and stuff... We don't want that. 

## Features ONG!
Certainly! Here's a list of features this system has and features that we may do or that we may not:
-Built-in drivers! (Only for Dell Latitude 4800 and that weird-ass Weigo laptop..) 游릭
-Programs for children. For example, we have Chrome, Vs-code, scratch, and the Alkoritmika program) 游릭
-RESTRICTIONS, there are a lot of restrictions, I am only going to name a few: Disabling the audio driver because children like to blast music, Not letting them change the wallpapers, or having Admin privileges at all. 游릭
-Built-in User account, one is Admin with a password and admin privileges, and there is a Student one that has guest privileges. 游릭
-Skipping OOBE and other Microsoft b*llshit in setup 游릭
-Windows-SteadyState, well this one is a maybe.. 游리

## I want to add something!
To suggest an idea for a new section, you can try to write to me on social networks or in this e-mail:stefan.constantin2476@gmail.com 

## How many processes does it have running in the background?
45. 游땙
